# Bloqade-Shuttle

Bloqade-shuttle is an SDK for simulation and running neutral atom quantum computers
with explicit shuttling. The goal of this project is to provide both a frontend language
for programming neutral atom quantum computers as well as an IR for optimizing
scheduling of atom shuttling operations. While this project falls under the
[`Bloqade`](https://bloqade.quera.com/latest/) umbrella, we are still in the early
stages of development, and we are focusing on building a steering committee for this
project and gathering feedback on the design of the language and the IR to further the
development of neutral atom quantum computers and their applications.

The language and IR with [`Kirin`](https://queracomputing.github.io/kirin/latest/)
which provides a easy to use framework for building domain specific languages with a
built-in python frontend and IR with a focus on lowering the barrier to entry for
building compilers for more scientific applications.

## Installation

```bash
uv add bloqade-shuttle
