# Bloqade-Shuttle

SDK for simulation and running neutral atom quantum computers with explicit shuttling.
The goal of this project is to provide both a frontend language for programming neutral
atom quantum computers as well as an IR for optimizaing scheduling of atom shuttling
operations. While this project falls under the `Bloqade` umbrella, we are still in the
early stages of development, and we are focusing on building a steering committee for
this project and gathering feedback on the design of the language and the IR to further
the development of neutral atom quantum computers and their applications.

## Installation

```bash
uv add bloqade-shuttle
```
<! TODO: update links to point to documentation website once available. >
See [Installation](install.md) for more details.
